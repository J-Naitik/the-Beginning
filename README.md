# 🎉 My Fun Little Portfolio Project 🧑‍💻

Hey there! 👋  
This is a small personal project I made just for **fun** during the early days of my web dev journey.  
Nothing too serious — just me experimenting with HTML, CSS, and some cool effects! 😄

---

## 🚀 What is this?

A portfolio-style web page where I play around with:
- 🧱 HTML layout
- 🎨 CSS styling using variables, gradients, shadows & more
- 🔤 Typing animation using [Typed.js](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js)
- 💡 A glowing, neon theme (because why not?)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (aka what I tried messing with)

- HTML5  
- CSS3 (with custom properties aka variables 🌈)  
- JavaScript (just a bit!)  
- Typed.js library

## ✨ Features

- Glowing text and buttons 💡  
- Animated introduction using a typing effect ⌨️  
- A mock-up navbar with hover effects  
- Image styling with colorful borders and drop shadows 🎨  
- A mysterious `%` button (it doesn't do anything... yet 👀)

---

## ❗ Just a Heads-Up

This is **not responsive** (yet 😅).  
It may look weird on small screens — but I was more focused on having fun and learning stuff!

---

## 📚 Why I Made This

I wanted to:
- Get comfortable writing HTML/CSS from scratch 🛠️  
- Experiment with design ideas without any framework 🎨  
- Feel the joy of creating something that glows on screen 💻✨  
- Keep things lighthearted while learning 🚶‍♂️

## 📬 Wanna Say Hi?

No real contact form yet 😅  
But feel free to fork this and have fun with it too!

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

This was a cool little project I built at the start of my dev journey.  
It’s not perfect, but it’s mine — and that’s what makes it special. 💖

> Built with curiosity, colors, and a dash of chaos 😄
